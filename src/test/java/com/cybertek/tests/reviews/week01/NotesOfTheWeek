5. In Selenium we wil learn bunch of Methods:
        #1 What is the method doing?
        #2 Does it accept any argument (parameters)?
        #3 Does it return anything? What is return type?
        #4 Does it throw an exception? -> we need to handle the exception
            #example: get() method
            #1 This gets the given url in an already opened browser
            #2 This method accepts String as an argument -> url
            #3 This is void method, not returning
